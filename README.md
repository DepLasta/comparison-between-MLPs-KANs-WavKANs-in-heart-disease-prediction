# comparison-between-MLPs-KANs-WavKANs-in-heart-disease-prediction
Advancements in Cardiovascular Disease Prediction: A Comparative Study of Multilayer Perceptrons, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, and Wavelet-Enhanced KAN Models

## Introduction
This project compares the performance of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and WavKANs in predicting heart disease. The goal is to determine which method provides the most accurate predictions.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
